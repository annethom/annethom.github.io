The Case of Sally Muller
</h2>

<table><tr><td>
This case of a light skinned woman who sued for her freedom is especially fascinating to me because of the defendant, a planter by the 
name of John F. Miller. He was one of the traffickers who held my 3 and 2x great grandmothers Charlotte Gillis, and Ann Randolph, captive. 
In the 1840s Sally Muller was recognized by fellow German immigrants 20 years after her disappearance and 
they convinced the Louisiana supreme court of her identity. The argument they used is painful to read.

<i>Their decision in Miller v. Belmonti (1845 La) included the following
statement:<br/>
<p><i>
That on the law of slavery in the
case of a person visibly appearing to be a white man, or an Indian,
the presumption is he is free, and it is necessary for his adversity
to show that he is a slave.
</i></br></p>

The supreme court justices who
overturned the case and freed Sally, were ousted in short order by
angry traffickers. "It was an unpopular decision in a time and place where many slaves were
mixed race and appeared to be &quot;white&quot;. in March 1846
the Louisiana State Constitutional Convention abolished the Supreme
Court, ending Martin's career as a jurist. When the Convention
reconstituted the court the following day, it did not reappoint
Martin or his fellow five justices. </i></br>
