The Case of Sally Muller
</h2>

<table><tr><td>
This case of a woman who sued for her freedom is especially fascinating to me because the defendant, John Miller, was 
one of the traffickers who imprisoned my 3 and 2x great grandmothers Charlotte Gillis, and Ann Randolph. 
In the 1840s, 20 years after her disappearance, Sally Muller was fortuitously recognized by fellow German immigrants. With their help 
she convinced the Louisiana supreme court of her identity and was emancipated.
 The argument used in her successful petition demonstrates the racial climate of the time:

Their decision in Miller v. Belmonti (1845 La) included the following
statement:<br/>
<p><i>
That on the law of slavery in the
case of a person visibly appearing to be a white man, or an Indian,
the presumption is he is free, and it is necessary for his adversity
to show that he is a slave.
</i><br></p>

The supreme court justices who
overturned the case and freed Sally, were ousted in short order by
angry traffickers. "It was an unpopular decision in a time and place where many slaves were
mixed race and appeared to be &quot;white&quot;. in March 1846
the Louisiana State Constitutional Convention abolished the Supreme
Court, ending Martin's career as a jurist. When the Convention
reconstituted the court the following day, it did not reappoint
Martin or his fellow five justices."" </br>
